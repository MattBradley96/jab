# Will We Free?

I have something to wonder about this "free will" of yours.

And if you have not such, you may find my wandering tedious.

## Literature Review

Schopenhauer claimed to prove the so-called [apriority of the principle of causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche_and_free_will#The_principle_of_causality) (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will#Free_will_and_views_of_causality)), which remains premised on `one's will`.


[Luther's argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche_and_free_will#Necessity_vs._contingency): for him everything is a necessity because the Creator knows it already. 

Free will is a [causa sui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causa_Sui_(band)) error, IRL it's a question of stronger or weaker, not how constrained. And nothing in this world can be immutable, so `will` is considered a mental power: things are _determined_ by `will`. A godless man becomes pious out of "grace", he did not want it, and likewise a pious man becomes godless with no merit or guilt. 

### Is itself ruled? 

[Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volition_(psychology)) is something that determines human acts, thoughts etc. It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something
 

## Who are you?

Who is this "you" that is willing freely? 

At least in the short term, at least when focus is on and the chips are down: what is this "you" that is willing?

Have you ever watched yourself deciding? Have you ever sat, typing, at a computer, and taken a break, ..., and had a sip, and _watched_ yourself deciding to do that? 

Had a good _long_ look? With a coffee, or a soup, or a Martini, that you can come back to, again, and again, and again and watch yourself coming back to, again, and again, and again. To see if you can see yourself decide to do that?

Obviously not, and yet you have decided to tell me that ...

### What do you do?

What does it feel like? This deciding that you do?

### Who told you?

Monty Python joke please.

### What's it to you?

Give you â‚¬10 if you stop spouting that reactionary bullshit, yeah?

## Who am I?

I've never seen a will, nor a way. I've been looking, had reason to look. 

Had good reason to put a lot of my years into looking for a tning that was me and could say this stuff to you.

But I remain random gbberish held together by alcohol and drugs.
