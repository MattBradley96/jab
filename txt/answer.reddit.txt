> That's a great question

In order as I find them in my [BeyondPod](https://www.beyondpod.mobi/android/index.htm) feed, which means in order of most recent downloads:

* [The Podcast Radio Hour](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09n14fm) If you'd like to discover more podcasts, then this is the obvious one to start with. Usually reviews and plays bits from 2 podcasts per episode, and often has the creators in for a chat as well.
* [Future Tense](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/futuretense/) for an Aussie view on the future of just about everything, e.g. last few have covered the futures of food, AI, Construction with timber, diplomacy, ... I like it for the breadth of topics mostly, and the reminders that we are still making lots of progress in all kinds of ways.
* [The Wright Show](https://bloggingheads.tv/programs/wrightshow) is an interview which covers "ideas" with a kinda left-leaning, Buddhist, psycho-/neuro-logical bent, but again it's a very broad one.
* [The News Quiz](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9pj/episodes/downloads) Comedians discuss this week's news headlines on one of the BBC's "Friday Night Comedy" shows. (This is the one I keep for the shower on Saturday)
* [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily) - A slighly deeper dive into one story from the New York Times, every weekday. I'm fairly new to this, and have enjoyed most of it.
* [In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads) Melvyn Bragg brings 3 professors into the studio to waffle on about their field for nearly an hour. Covers Science, History Philosophy and Culture. A bit hit-and-miss, but the good ones are _excellent_.
* [Thinking Allowed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qy05/episodes/downloads) Another BBC show interviewing academics, but this time exclusively about Social Science. Nowhere near the level of "In Our Time", and TBH I skip most episodes. But It's OK as a backup if I get through everything else in the feed
* [Inside Politics](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/inside-politics) from The Irish Times. Mostly the journos interviewing each other, and very local. But if that's your thing it is well done, interesting conversations
* [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show/): "where science politics and society collide". Mostly interviews with the colliders. And the subjects are usually more interesting than the questions.
* [All In The Mind](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/allinthemind/): Covers anything that could be connected to "The Mind". Mostly from a clinical perspective, but they do branch out to all areas. (Note: this is the Australian one. There's an eponymous one from the BBC which is not as good)
* [History Of Philosophy Without Any Gaps](https://historyofphilosophy.net/) is literally that. It started with "the pre-Socratics" a few hundred years BC and has been getting through everyone of any interest week-by-week for the 8 years since. Currently leaving the Middle Ages and approaching the Renaissance. "Major" philosophers like Plato and Aquinas will be covered over a few weeks. Most episodes are based on an idea at a time and so could cover a few minor figures in one show. (~~See~~ Hear also offshoots such as "History of Philosophy in India" and "History of Africana Philosopy"). Definitely one of my favourites.
* [Alan Watts](http://www.alanwattspodcast.com/) I do not always agree with Alan Watts, but he does always make his case in a way that makes me think, and makes me try to figure out exactly _why_ "he's wrong". Episodes are often one quarter of his original hour-long lecture. Publication has been less regular lately.
* [The Secular Buddhist](http://secularbuddhism.org/category/podcasts/). One-on-one interviews with anyone in the field. Although this has been going for a while, and the field is small enough so guests can be just "Buddhist", or even just "Secular", so there's bound to be a few less interesting guests, no matter your own approach. Very laid back, a good one to fall asleep to.
* [What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law](https://www.radiotopia.fm/podcasts/trump-con-law). A side-project of Roman Mars, who hosts "99% Invisible" and has the best voice of any podcast presenter, so I would listen to this just for that (and high production values). But the premise is great too: What new shit did Trump get up to this week? Can he get away with that? What does the US Constitution say? Let's ask Mars' neighbour, who just happens to be a Professor of Constitutional Law.
* [Theory of Everything](http://theoryofeverythingpodcast.com/) which could be about anything at all, although currently going through a 9/10 part series on what I'd loosely summarize as "Fakes vs Truth". It has also taken me on tourist jaunts through Ohio and France, has broken the 4th wall, and ... well everything really. One podcaster, some friends who are good actors and journalists and ... everything really.
* [The Allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/) is to dictionaries as "99% Invisible" is to design. If that's not "your thing" you may skip it, but that'd be a mistake. Becuase the premise is just a starting point from which Helen Saltzman leads us into great stories, discussions and asides.
* [Brain Science](http://brainsciencepodcast.com/). An "interview per episode" podcast, talking to Academic NeuroScientists, Psychiatrists, ... Definitely "serious science here", and you will come away knowing more brain-anatomy terms than you thought you needed. A show like that depends very much on quality of the guests, but it does continue to amaze me with what great personalities these profs and clinicians have.
* [The John Peel Lecture](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0175jw5/episodes/downloads). This comes out as one episode per year, and is a recording of a lecture in honour of [The Greatest DJ Ever](http://peel.wikia.com/wiki/John_Peel). Hence each year's lecture is about some aspect of music, and the lecturers are all (so far) musicians, including Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, Pete Townsend, ...

Others have already mentioned these ITT, but I like them too, and you might like the links:

* [Criminal](http://thisiscriminal.com/) is about "criminality" rather than just a "True Crime podcast", e.g. latest was a profile of Texas lawyer Racehorse Haynes
* [RadioLab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab). _The best_ produced podcast of all. Started out exploring the edges of Science brilliantly, but has been getting more political, and less interesting, lately.
* [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/) takes one a single story per season laid out week by week. We've just started season 3, which was entirely recorded in the courthouse in Cleveland.
* [Waking Up](https://samharris.org/podcast/): Sam Harris interviews the IDW and beyond.
* [RadioLab Presents: More Perfect](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect). Started out as an interesting case-per-episode look at what the US Supreme Court is and does. But for season 3 they have come up with the "Good Idea" of recording an album with one song for each Amendment to the US Consitution. With the podcast acting as "extended liner notes". Hmmm, we'll see ...
* [Slow Burn](http://www.slate.com/articles/slate_plus/watergate.html) Season 1 covered Watergate, and the near-impeachment of Nixon. Season 2 covered the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and I hope [your current politics](/r/the_donald) will give them enough material for Season 3
* [Very Bad Wizards](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/): A philosopher and a psychologist chat with each other. Wouldn't be one that I'd make sure to hear, but worth a listen if it comes up in the feed. Title is very clever, and they are too.
* [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/) Second (in my list) only to RadioLab for production values, and Roman Mars has _the best_ voice to listen to. Obstensibly the podcast covers "design", but one of the things I love about it is getting through the first quarter/half/more of a show of a show thinking "This is just a good story, it's not really about design", and then they twist it, or just look at things a different way, and there's that "Aha!" moment, and it is about design after all. But just not what you'd think was "Design"
* [Invisibilia](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia) A story per week about the "invisible things" that control our lives. No - not conspiracy nuts, more like (e.g.) how we tell ourselves stories about "who I am", and then the sories start determining "who I am"

Sorry the list is a bit short, but the new phone is in for repair, so these are just the ones from the old phone. And OP asked for only the ones I most enjoy.
