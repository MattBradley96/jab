When I finish coding all day for money, I code some more by night for free.

I'm extending bash, cd, type, python, parsers and AI over at GitHub, one commit at a time.

I mash movies and musics into , one session at a time.

I retire in less than a decade and have no pension.

I could tell you stories, and have ideas for videos, given an actor.
