	>>> from pprint import pprint
	>>> import paths
	>>> paths.path('.').mp3_files()
	[]

paths reads from environ
	>>> import environ

And looks for paths therein
	It tries anything with a "/"
	>>> environ.AMG_SOURCE
	'/mnt/source/amg'
	>>> paths.AMG_SOURCE
	<path "'/mnt/source/amg'">
	>>> paths.EDITOR
	<path "'/bin/vim'">

If it looks like a path, but does not exist 
	then it is not converted to a path
	>>> environ.VERSION
	'4.5/RC30'
	>>> paths.VERSION
	'4.5/RC30'

And not all are tried
	>>> print environ.HISTSIZ
	100000
	>>> print paths.HISTSIZ
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  ...
	AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'HISTSIZ'

Path lists are split up,
	only existing paths are kept in the resulting list
	>>> pprint( environ.PYTHONPATH )
	'/home/builder/python/site:/home/builder/.jab/python/site:/mnt/source/amg/trunk/trackers/builder:/home/builder/python25/lib/python2.5/site-packages/altobridge'

The first one doesn't exist
	>>> pprint( paths.PYTHONPATH )
	[<path "'/home/builder/.jab/python/site'">,
	 <path "'/mnt/source/amg/trunk/trackers/builder'">,
	 <path "'/home/builder/python25/lib/python2.5/site-packages/altobridge'">]
