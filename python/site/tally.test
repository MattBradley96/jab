The tally module
================

	>>> import tally

A Tally is ako list
	>>> l = [0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]
	>>> fred = tally.Tally(l)
	>>> print fred
	[0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]

With a different %r than list
	>>> l
	[0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]
	>>> fred
	<Tally [0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]>

And can parse out its class name
	>>> print fred.class_name(), fred.full_class_name(), fred.list_name()
	Tally tally.Tally Tallies

A subclass of Tally
	>>> class Freddy(tally.Tally): pass
	>>> fred = Freddy(l)

is also ako list
	>>> print fred
	[0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]

and knows its class
	>>> fred
	<Freddy [0, 1, 'hello', 2, 3]>

and parses its name
	Note:
		full class name has no module as it was created in this script
	Note again:
		This is now version dependent, 2.7 calls this script's module "__main__"
	>>> print fred.class_name(), fred.full_class_name(), fred.list_name()
	Freddy ...Freddy Freddies

I think this one is a meta-sub-class
	but it might be a sub-meta-class.
	Anyway, the class name you provide is sent into a method
	>>> from tally import tlist
	>>> Teddy = tlist('Teddy')

And that gives you a new class
	Initialised from a string, just for a change
	>>> ted = Teddy('ted')

When it starts from a string it still looks like a string
	>>> print ted
	ted
	>>> ted
	<Teddy 'ted'>

But it is really ako list
	>>> try: print ted.upper()
	... except AttributeError: print ted.pop()
	d

It still parses its name the same way
	>>> print ted.class_name(), ted.full_class_name(), ted.list_name()
	Teddy tally.Teddy Teddies
