The site/spine module
=====================

    >>> import spine
    >>> assert 'the spine of a class' in  spine.__doc__

A Thing is a kind of Spine
    which can provide a string value
    >>> class Thing(spine.Spine):
    ...     def __str__(self):
    ...         return 'string'

Instantiate a thing
    >>> thing = Thing()

The repr() includes the string value
    >>> thing
    <Thing 'string'>

Names are as expected
    >>> thing.full_class_name() == '__main__.Thing' and thing.class_name() == 'Thing' and thing.list_name() == 'Things'
    True

One fish, two fish
------------------

    >>> class Fish(spine.Spine):
    ...     pass
    >>> fish = Fish()

Plurals are handled properly
    >>> fish.class_name() == fish.list_name()
    True
