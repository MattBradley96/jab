The mail module
===============

    >>> import mail
    >>> assert 'handle mail' in  mail.__doc__

Read boring issues
------------------

Boring issues are stored in a file, and re-read for each email
    >>> try:
    ...     assert mail.is_boring_issue('19034')
    ... except FileNotFoundError as e:
    ...     assert 'boring_issues' in str(e)
