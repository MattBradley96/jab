Collection of smaller commands

These comands are particularly important as they are most frequently used.

Aim: For a key "x" there should be commands "x", "xx", "xxx"

Each letter needs at least the first three, but may have more.

A script can contain similar commands as long as they start with (if x is the letter) "[_]*x"
